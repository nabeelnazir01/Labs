                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <h4>My name is Nabeel Nazir. I was born here in Ottawa, but my mom is from Pakistan and my dad is from
                    Sierra Leone. The reason why I chose Algonquin College is mainly that it has a nice program for
                    computer engineering. My brother has taken the course at Algonquin and I got some great feedback
                    from him. The reason why I chose computer engineering is that I grew up loving anything with
                    technology. <br><br>As a kid and even now I would just be on the computer trying to learn new things
                    and solve problems that I had. In school, I would always help my friends and even teachers when
                    facing technical problems. When I got into programming, I instantly fell in love with it because I
                    can make whatever I want, and I just had to learn more. When I am not at school, I love to play
                    video games by myself or with friends. My favourite sport is ping pong and I grew up playing it. I
                    go and play ping pong a few times a week with friends and other people. I also enjoy solving puzzles
                    such as the Rubikâ€™s cube and anything similar. </h4>
